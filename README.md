 Event Planner Website


MEMORIES TIES specializes in creating beautiful and unique Weddings, Social Engagements and Corporate Events. We provide a multitude of services ranging from Day-of to Full Service Event Coordination, and everything in between. Your coordinator will collaborate with you to produce an unforgettable event that will be tailored to you and your vision. During a complimentary initial consultation, you will have the opportunity to look through our portfolios, learn more about our services and ask any questions you may have. Once we determine what services are needed through this consultation, a proposal will be created and customized especially to your needs.
